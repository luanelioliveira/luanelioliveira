# About me ðŸ‘‹
I was born in Brazil. I worked in Accounting, Health and Logistic softwares in the past, but today I've worked with Tracking and Experimentation platform. These experiences gives me a new perspective looking at the details and forecasting limited resources, this also allows great improvements in logical thinking and problem-solving skills.

Now I'm into web development, working as a software engineer at  Interested in handling cross-platform cool ideas & developing real-world problem solutions.

I'm always aware of the existence of a variated pool of skills that makes me humble & listen-first-minded. I also have strong logical communication skills and a problem-solving attitude.

My highest goal is to make the world a better place through tech. Never forget that tech is always a tool and not a purpose by itself.

I speak Portuguese and enough English to be a valuable contributor :)
