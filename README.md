# About me ðŸ‘‹
Hi there! 

My name is Luan. I'm 31 years old and I was born in Brazil. 

Currently, I'm a Software Enginner at OLX Brazil and I've been working with Tracking and Experimentation platform but I already worked in Accounting, Health and Logistic softwares in the past.

These experiences gave me a new perspective looking at the details and forecasting limited resources, this also allows great improvements in logical thinking and problem-solving skills. 

I'm always aware of the existence of a variated pool of skills that makes me humble & listen-first-minded. I also have strong logical communication skills and a problem-solving attitude.

My highest goal is to make the world a better place through tech.

I speak Portuguese and enough English to be a valuable contributor :)
