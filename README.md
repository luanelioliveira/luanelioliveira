# About me ðŸ‘‹

Hi there! 

I have been working with software development for 12+ years and worked with technologies such as Java, Node, Python for building backend applications and React JS for building frontend applications. In addition, I have experience with Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes and AWS Services as a Cloud Provider. A few years ago, I graduated in Systems Development and Analysis and then did a postgraduate degree in Software Engineering as well.
